## Question 1

You are given three grades obtained by 3 students, which are stored in variables `grade1`, `grade2`, `grade3` and all of type `Double`.
Create a variable called `yourGrade` of type `Double` and give it a value.
Print `"above average"` if your grade is greater than the class average or `"below average"` otherwise.

```swift
var grade1 = 7.0
var grade2 = 9.0
var grade3 = 5.0

// your code here
```
 var grade1 = 7.0
 var grade2 = 9.0
 var grade3 = 5.0

 var aboveAverage = 
 var yourGrade = ("grade1","grade2","grade3")

***
## Question 2

You are given a number. Print even if the number is even or odd otherwise.

```swift
let number = 2

// your code here
```
let number = 2 
print(number) 

***
## Question 3

You are given two numbers `a` and `b`. Print `"divisible"` if `a` is divisible by `b` and `"not divisible"` otherwise.

```swift
var a = 12
var b = 3

// code here
```

***
## Question 4

You are given three variables `a`, `b` and `c`. Check if at least two variables have the same value. If that is true, print `"At least two variables have the same value"` otherwise print `"All the values are different"`.

```swift
var a = 2
var b = 3
var c = 2

// your code here
```

***
## Question 5

You are working on a smart-fridge. The smart-fridge knows how old the eggs and bacon in it are. You know that eggs spoil after 3 weeks (21 days) and bacon after one week (7 days). Given `baconAge` and `eggsAge` (both in days) determine if you can cook bacon and eggs, or which ingredients you need to throw out. If you can cook bacon and eggs, print `"you can cook bacon and eggs"`. If you need to throw out any ingredients, for each one print a line with the text `"throw out"` + bacon or eggs.

```swift
var baconAge = 6 // the bacon is 6 days old
var eggsAge = 12 // eggs are 12 days old

// your code here
```

***
## Question 6

You are given a year, determine if it’s a leap year. A leap year is a year containing an extra day. It has 366 days instead of the normal 365 days. The extra day is added in February, which has 29 days instead of the normal 28 days. Leap years occur every 4 years. 2012 was a leap year and 2016 will also be a leap year.
The above rule is valid except that every 100 years special rules apply. Years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years if they are not also divisible by 400. For example 1900 was not a leap year, but 2000 was. Print `"Leap year!"` or `"Not a leap year!"` depending on the year you are provided.

```swift
let year = 2014

// your code here
```

***
## Question 7

If you use `random()` it will give you a random number within a specified range. Generate a random number and use it to simulate a coin toss. Print `"heads"` or `"tails"`.

```swift
let randomNum = Int.random(in: 0...100)

// your code here
```

Hint: use an if/else block along with the `%` operator

***
## Question 8

You are given four variables `a`, `b`, `c` and `d`. Print the value of the smallest one.

```swift
var a = 5
var b = 6
var c = 3
var d = 4

// your code here
```

***
## Question 9

Which of the following expressions evaluate to true?

```swift
a. 3 == 2 || 9 == 9
b. !(3 > 3)
c. !(true || false)
d. (4 < 3 || 4 > 3) && ("Message: " == "Message: ")
e. !(3 != 3)

```

***
## Question 10

Given the below, which of the following expressions evaluate to true?

```swift
 let x = 5 > 4
 let y = 100 / 10 == 1
 let z = 6
```

```swift
a. x && y
b. x || y || z == 1
c. ("five" == "5" || "FIVE" == "five" || 5 == 3 + 2) && !y
d. (x && y) || z > 6
e. !(z < 6) && !y && !x

```


***
## Question 11

What is true about Integers in computers?

```swift
a. Integers must have a positive or negative sign always.
b. The maximum value for Integers is +∞.
c. Integer types in computers take up a fixed amount of memory.
d. Integers may contain decimals.

```


***
## Question 12

Select all the code snippets below that will compile.

```swift
a. let numberOfPages: Int = 500
b. let numberOfChapters = "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
c. let nameOfBook: Int = 14
d. let yearPublished = "Nineteen-thirty-five"

```

***
## Question 13

What will the code below print?  Complete this exercise without using an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) or calculator 

```swift
var a = 20
var b = 5
var c = 4

a += b
b -= c
b * (c + a)
(b * c) + a
b %= a
b %= c

print(a + b + c)

```

***
## Question 14

let div = 11 / 4

```swift
1. The value of div is ____________________(or write "div1 will not compile")

let div2 = 11.0 / 4.0
2. The value of div2 is ________________________(or write "div2 will not compile")
let isEqual = div == div2

3. The value of isEqual is_____________________ (or write "isEqual will not compile")


```
